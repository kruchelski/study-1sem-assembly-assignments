# ASSEMBLY ASSIGNMENTS  

## Assmebly language exercises for practice in the Computer Archicteture Introduction course / First semester  
---
### Description  
These activities are for practice purposes. There are 17 exercises, of which 16 were solved. The software used for programming is an 8086 emulator for MS windows. The list of exercises is in the .pdf file in the repository (in portuguese).  

### Considerations
As these exercises were solved for learning purposes, it doesn't represent the best solutions. Every suggestion is welcome (altough that I probably won't be messing around with this since I don't work with assembly in my daily activities... But, who knows?)

**Important**: The reason I created this repository is to share with other colleagues or anyone who needs examples of assembly exercises.
